## Description

This repository contains one folder, "code", which contains all the resources to carry out the technical experiments discussed in the paper (in Section 5). Then, we also provide the following additional files (as PDF):

* "Expert_Interviews.pdf", which provides an overview of the interviews with SME (discussed in Section 3 of the paper)
* "Questionnaire.pdf", which reports the questionnaire shown to our SME for our user study (discussed in Section 4);
* "userStudy_results.pdf", which reports the complete results of our user study (discussed in Section 4 of the paper)
* "supplementary.pdf", which reports the figures with the remaining performance metrics computed for our experiments (discussed in Section 5 of the paper).
* "paper.pdf", which is a preprint version of our paper.

### Remark

This paper stems from the MSc. Thesis authored by the first author of the paper: Tobias Braun (who obtained his MSc. degree in Information Systems at the University of Liechtenstein in August 2023). The thesis includes more detailed analysis and results than the ones shown in the paper. Furthermore, the code was entirely developed by Tobias Braun. If anyone is interested in these additional perspectives, or if they have comments on the code, they are solicited to contact the Tobias Braun (by emailing him at: tm.braun@outlook.de).
